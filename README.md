# Internet Explorer Chrome

## Installation

* [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/internet-explorer-chrome/aafcanndlpmjkkobofgnmbabibhioine)
* [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/internet-explorer-chrome/)

Chrome's dominant market share has made Chrome the new Internet Explorer.
Large enterprises have become lazy and often only support chrome.
So why not label the shiny 'chrome' what it should remind us all of?

Naw I'm joking, use whatever browser you want. :laughing:

Anyhoo, the web extension is all located in `app/`. An image model
was trained, with some resources on how to retrain using Keras in `train/`.
